# GCI Tasks: Incoming Webhook Integrations

## Prerequisites

* A working Zulip development environment. See
  https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/README.md for instructions
  on how to set one up.

## Background

A [Zulip integration](https://zulipchat.com/integrations/) is a special type
of bot that brings information from the outside world into Zulip. Zulip
integrations allow teams to stay up-to-date on code changes, issue tickets,
build system results, tweets, and more. Zulip currently has over 50
integrations, but there are at least 50 more remaining to be written.

As an example, see [this commit](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/324/files)
for the code that added the Travis integration.

## Task Descriptions

### Task Type A: Create a personalized integration.

Follow the tutorial below to create a duplicate of our
[HelloWorld integration](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration-guide.html#hello-world-webhook-walkthrough)
that is named after yourself, and sends a unique message you’d like to share
with the world. As you’re going through the tutorial, take notes on where
you got stuck or needed to look up terminology.

Notation: Everywhere below, <yourname> should be replaced by your name in
lowercase (no spaces or underscores), and <YourName> should be replaced by
your name in CamelCase.

* Create a new directory `zerver/fixtures/<yourname>`.

* Add a json file to this directory `zerver/fixtures/<yourname>/<yourname>_hello.json`
  that contains fixtures like:
  ```
    {
      "featured_title":"Harry Potter",
      "featured_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter",
    }
  ```

* Add a new file `zerver/views/webhooks/<yourname>.py`

* Copy the contents of the `helloworld.py` to this file. Replace all instances of `HelloWorld` and `helloworld` with <YourName> and <yourname>, respectively. Also choose a new topic below (replace <your_topic>)
  ```
    def api_<yourname>_webhook(request, user_profile, client,
                               payload=REQ(argument_type='body'),
                               stream=REQ(default='test'),
                               topic=REQ(default='<your_topic>')):
  ```
  and play around with the `body`.

* Open `zerver/lib/integrations.py` and look for the lines beginning with:
  ```
    WEBHOOK_INTEGRATIONS = [
  ```
  At the end of this section, add
  ```
    WebhookIntegration('<yourname>', display_name='<yourname>'),
  ```

* Start the server. If using vagrant, you can do this by running `/srv/zulip/tools/run-dev.py`.
  This will start your development server at
  [http://localhost:9991/](http://localhost:9991/)

* Create a bot under the `Your Bots` section of your Zulip user’s `Settings`
  page and copy the API key.

* Send the fixture message you wrote above! Replace the placeholder
  `<api_key>` in the code below with your real API key and `<yourname>`
  with your name:

```
(zulip-venv)vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/srv/zulip$./manage.py send_webhook_fixture_message \
--fixture=zerver/fixtures/<yourname>/<yourname>_hello.json \
'--url=http://localhost:9991/api/v1/external/<yourname> api_key=<api_key>'
```

* Take two screenshots, and put them in a new folder called `gci/incoming-webhooks/<yourname>/`:

 * Take a screenshot of the log line you get on the terminal after you
   finish your task. It should look something like:

```
    2016-11-18 15:58:04,600 INFO     127.0.0.1       POST    200 643ms (mem: 34ms/16) (md: 155ms/1) (db: 166ms/15q) (+start: 18ms) /api/v1/external/<yourname> (<bot_name>-bot@zulip.com via Zulip<YourName>Webhook)
```

 * On your local server, you will see a new message in the `test`
   stream. Take a screenshot of the message.

* Post your notes of where you got stuck or found confusing terminology to the
  "GCI task discussion" stream, under the topic "Incoming Webhooks".

* Post your work as a pull request to the zulip/gci-submissions
  repository. The title of the pull request should be "Incoming Webhooks A".

### Task Type B: Learn how an integration works in Slack.

Let *integration* be the integration listed in the task that brought you
here.  Follow the tutorial below to test how *integration* works with
Slack. You will also be generating webhook fixtures for *integration*.

* Create a test team with [Slack](https://slack.com/). Find *integration* at
  https://slack.com/apps, and add it your Slack team. You will likely have
  to create an account at *integration*'s site as well.

* Figure out how to add a webhook URL to your account on the integration's
  site. Each site will be different, but you can often find how to do this
  by Googling for "*integration* add a webhook". Put in a test URL generated by
  [RequestBin](http://requestb.in/) (click "Create a RequestBin") or a similar site.

* Play around with the integration to figure out all the different types of
  messages you can generate in Slack, and take a screenshot of each one
  (it's fine if multiple of these are in the same screenshot). Make a brief
  note about any messages you think are possible, but which you are unable
  to generate (e.g. because they are only available to paying customers).
  Put the screenshots and notes in a new folder
  `gci/webhook-integrations/<integration>`, where `<integration>` should be
  replaced by *integration* in lowercase.

* All these messages should also have been posted to your RequestBin
  URL. Put the webhook payloads generated for your integration in files like
  `zerver/fixtures/<integration>/<integration>_<message-type>.json`, where
  `<integration>` is replaced by *integration* in lowercase. You can look at
  other folders under `zerver/fixtures` to get a sense of what these should
  look like and how to name the files. Include exactly one payload for each
  type of message.

* Create two commits.
 * One for the webhook payloads. The commit message should be
   `*integration* integration: Add webhook payloads.`

 * One with the screenshots and notes. The commit message should be
   `*integration* integration: Screenshots and notes.`

* Submit a pull request to the zulip/gci-submissions project. The title of
  the pull request should be "Webhook Integrations B: Test fixtures for
  *integration*".

### Task Type C: Write handlers and tests for an integration.

Let *integration* be the integration listed in the task that brought you
here.

* Make sure you have access to the output of Task Type B for *integration*,
  namely the files in `gci/webhook-integrations/<integration>` and
 `zerver/fixtures/<integration>/`.

* Skim through http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration-guide.html#general-advice.

* Follow the instructions in Steps 1-3 at
  http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration-guide.html#hello-world-webhook-walkthrough.
  for *integration*. You'll need code paths and tests for each of the
  fixtures; see the Semaphore integration for an example of an integration
  with multiple fixtures.

* Make sure all the tests pass, using `tools/test-all`.

* Create a commit titled `*integration* integration: Add webhook code, API
  endpoint, and tests.`

* Submit a pull request to the zulip/gci-submissions project. The title of
  the pull request should be "Webhook Integrations C: webhook code, API
  endpoint, and tests for *integration*".

### Task Type D: Add documentation for an integration.

Let *integration* be the integration listed in the task that brought you
here.

* Make sure you have access to the output of Task Type C for *integration*.
  For instance, check that there is something in the file
  `zerver/views/webhooks/*integration*.py`.

* If you didn't do Task Type B for this integration, create an account at
  *integration*'s site.

* Follow the instructions at
  http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration-guide.html#documenting-your-integration
  for *integration*.

* Add a roughly 250x250 pixel logo image for your integration under the
  `static/images/integrations/logos/<integration>.png`, where
  `<integration>` is the name of the integration in lower case.

* Generate a message sent by the integration by giving your test bot a nice
  name like "`<integration>` Bot", use the project’s logo as the bot’s
  avatar, and take the screenshots showing the stream/topic bar for the
  message, not just the message body, doing something like:

  ```
  ./manage.py send_webhook_fixture_message --
  fixture=zerver/fixtures/<integration>/<integration>_<message_type>.json url=/api/v1/external/<integration>?stream=<stream_name>&api_key=<api_key>'
  ```

  Take a screenshot and save it as
  `/static/images/integrations/<integration>/<number>.png` where `number`
  is something like `001`. See the other folders in `/static/images/integrations/`
  for examples.

* In `templates/zerver/integrations.html`, add an `integration-instructions` class block in
  the alphabetically correct place, explaining all the steps required to
  setup the integration, including screenshots. Search the file for `semaphore` for an example.

* Make sure all the tests pass, using `tools/test-all`.

* Create a commit titled `*integration* integration: Add documentation.`

* Submit a pull request to the zulip/gci-submissions project. The title of
  the pull request should be "Webhook Integrations D: documentation for *integration*".

## General notes

If there is an integration Zulip doesn't have that you would like to add,
please let us know on the "webhook integrations" topic on the "GCI task
discussion" stream!
