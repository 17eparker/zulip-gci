# Submit A Pull Request to Zulip GCI Repository

This task is for getting you familiarize with the GitHub flow.  If you
are already familiar with making a pull request in GitHub, feel free
to skip this task.

We would recommend you to go through
[this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) if
you are not familiar with making a pull request. The tutorial would
teach you to fork, create a branch, commit and make a new pull request
just by using GitHub. You can also use command line (git) for creating
branch and making commits. This is not necessary for completing this
task but is a skill that you should learn sooner or later. Here is a
[great tutorial](https://try.github.io) if you want to learn Git.

## Task

* Fork the [zulip-gci](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci) repository.
If you are not sure what `fork` means refer to [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork).

* Create a new branch called `submit-a-pull-request` in the forked repository.
If you are not sure what a branch is refer to [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#branch).

* Make a new folder `submit-a-pull-request/`**`username`** where **username** is your GitHub username.

* Create a new file called `hello-world.md` with the following
content. Don't replace the "username" below with your GitHub username
for now.

```markdown
# Hello world

I am username. :tada:
```

* Now commit the change you just made as `Create hello-world.md.`
Refer to
[this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#commit)
if you are not sure what commit means.

* Now open the file again and replace `username` in the file with your
  actual GitHub username.

* Now commit the changes you just made as `Add Github handle to hello-world.md.`

* Now open a Pull Request to this zulip-gci repository. Refer to
[this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr)
if you don't know how to make a pull request.

The mentors will verify that you successfully created a pull request
with 2 commits, first adding the file and then editing it to contain
your username.  Congratulations!  You've learned the basics of GitHub
workflow.
